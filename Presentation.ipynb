    "Whenever you do any data analysis, you'll probably be writing code to do it.  As scientists especially, that code should be open-source because that's crucial to reproducibility, and so that your code can be used by others to build on your work — which is good for science, and good for you personally.  But when working on open-source code, the de facto meeting place is github, which is home to most of the major open-source scientific projects (among many others).  In fact, many employers look at your github presence as if it were part of your resume — as evidence of your ability to write code in various languages, and interact well with others.  You can start out just by making an account, and downloading a package that you want to use.  Then you can open issues (bug reports) if you find any problems or have any questsion.  As you get experience, you can fork other projects and create pull requests for fixes or new features you add to other people's code, and even create your own projects.  One easy way to get started with pull requests is just to improve the documentation for some project that you've used.\n",

And if you're using python interactively, you'll want to us Jupyter (which is just a different interface) or -- better yet -- the Jupyter notebook."
