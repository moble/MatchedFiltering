    "Whenever you do any data analysis, you'll probably be writing code to do it.  As scientists especially, that code should be open-source because that's crucial to reproducibility, and so that your code can be used by others to build on your work — which is good for science, and good for you personally.  But when working on open-source code, the de facto meeting place is github, which is home to most of the major open-source scientific projects (among many others).  In fact, many employers look at your github presence as if it were part of your resume — as evidence of your ability to write code in various languages, and interact well with others.  You can start out just by making an account, and downloading a package that you want to use.  Then you can open issues (bug reports) if you find any problems or have any questsion.  As you get experience, you can fork other projects and create pull requests for fixes or new features you add to other people's code, and even create your own projects.  One easy way to get started with pull requests is just to improve the documentation for some project that you've used.\n",

So here's my unsolicited advice: if you're deciding what programming language to learn, go with python.  There are nerdier options out there, but not many more broadly useful options.  And if you're using python interactively, you'll want to us Jupyter (which is just a different interface) or -- better yet -- the Jupyter notebook."

First, take a look at this expression on the left, and you'll realize that it's actually a Fourier transform as a function of $\\delta t$ — usually called the inverse Fourier transform.  Since we can't really predict $\\delta t$ (it's just some time offset between our model and when nature decided the black holes would actually merge), we need to evaluate this quantity for all possible time offsets."

    "But the second reason is perhaps more important.  If I just look at any particular value on the right-hand side, there's just some data value at some instant of time, and I can't tell you whether that value is due to noise, or physics, or what.  But by looking very carefully at *correlations* between different instants of time, we can start to pick out which parts of the data are due to noise — at least statistically.  For example, one thing that's very common in nature is the harmonic oscillator.  Basically, any time a (possibly generalized) restoring force is proportional to some (possibly generalized) displacement, you get harmonic motion.  And since analytic functions always look linear for small displacements, you find this sort of thing a lot."
